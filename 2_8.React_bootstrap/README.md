# React Bootstrap

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

## What is React-Bootstrap?
 - React-Bootstrap is a library that rebuilds Bootstrap components using React components instead of jQuery or plain HTML classes.
 - You still get the Bootstrap styles, but with a React-friendly API.
 - It removes the need for jQuery (which doesn’t fit React’s declarative model).

## Install React-Bootstrap
```
npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap
```

Then import Bootstrap’s CSS in src/index.js or App.js:
```
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';
```
